# About Kids-Challenge
The Kids-Challenge game is a quiz for kids who love challenges. When deciding on a topic for the project. I wanted to do something my kid loves. My 4-year-old loves this quiz challenge, he is curious about everything and asks questions a lot, when I learned JavaScript, I wanted to make a quiz game for my son, which can be easy for kids of this age range and fun at the same time.

Users of this game will be able to easily navigate throughout the game. This game is fully interactive and gives feedback and alerts at every step to guide the users. This site is targeted toward kids who love challenges and fun.

# Bugs
* When I tested my HTML code for the index.html page on html validator, I got the error that one of the div element was unclosed which was causing another section to give another error, I solved the problem by removing that div element
* Another error I found for the menu.html page, where I put an anchor element inside a button element, I solved that error by replacing the button to form 
* For the style.css for the header element in a media query, I got an error because there was a margin selector that had a negative value, I solved that error by removing that selector

# Unfixed Bugs
